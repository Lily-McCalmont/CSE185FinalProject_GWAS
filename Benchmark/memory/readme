# To track memory usage for our program in real time, use the "top" command in terminal.

Note* 
It might be useful to open two terminals, one to run the program, and another to monitor the CPU and memory usage using top. 
Our results are shown in the MEM.png above.

This was the most effective way for use to benchmark memory after memusg did not work in terminal (for us).
