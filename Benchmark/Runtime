Using the time command to measure the runtime of plink versus our tool:

example: time mypileup -f example-files/test.fa example-files/test.bam

The result should look something like this:

real 0m0.171s // The real life time the command takes, it includes time taken by all processes.
user 0m0.143s // CPU time spent in user mode.
sys 0m0.028s // CPU time spent in kernel mode.


plink --linear association test
