# If there is trouble installing the packages needed, please reference the commands below.

When using conda to install pandas plink, make sure that the python environment is from anaconda. 
Otherwise, even if you install pandas plink using the command, it will not be the right environment.

If there is an error message:
"ImportError: DLL load failed while importing _imaging: The specified module could not be found."

Reinstall pillow in your terminal with:
pip uninstall pillow
pip install pillow

If using DataHub, and there is an error message:
"pandas_plink...module does not exist"
even after you used the conda install command for pandas plink, it is most likely because you are not using the anaconda python enviornment
There are two solutions: 
1. make sure you are using the python environment provided by anaconda and reinstall all packages again
2. use "pip install pandas-plink"
- the second command did not work for some of our members, which is why we opted for the conda install command
